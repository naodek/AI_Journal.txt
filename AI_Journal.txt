Week 1:
  Sorry in advance but I do not have any saved chats with ai websites because I did not know we had to but I can talk about how I have used Ai this week. When downloading VS code for this class I was having some trouble
getting it on my computer so I had Chat gpt guide me on a step by step process on how to work through my issue. I dont know if talking about ai use has to retain to class but a fun way I used AI this week was putting in
a bunch of resturants and having it choose which place to doordash from.

Week 2: I had trouble with question 28 on our assignment this week so I tried using Ai to figure it out but still could not. Outside of that I did not use ai at all for many things outside of trying to figure out what the best shampoo/conditioner for my hairtype was lol. I do like this assignment though. Not many opprotunites to just write, its really refreshing.
