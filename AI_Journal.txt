Week 1:
  Sorry in advance but I do not have any saved chats with ai websites because I did not know we had to but I can talk about how I have used Ai this week. When downloading VS code for this class I was having some trouble
getting it on my computer so I had Chat gpt guide me on a step by step process on how to work through my issue. I dont know if talking about ai use has to retain to class but a fun way I used AI this week was putting in
a bunch of resturants and having it choose which place to doordash from.
